    <p>
      Pairs of labels and URLs, separated by a "|", each pair on a new line. Minimum one pair.<br>
      "%%u" (without the quotes) will be replaced by the URL that was clicked.<br>
      Everything before the "|" will be used as the context menu label.<br>
      The resulting full URL will be opened in a new tab. If you only need to invoke the GET request, consider the send-link extension.
